/*  #4: Whitespace
 *  This is part of that formatting I was talking about
 *  Whitespace is the space between your code (think spaces, tabs, ect.)
 *  Even though the code will run the same, it's important to format
 *  
 * It's important to use whitespace to make your code readable :)
 * (Side note: My favorite quote about "readability" is:
 * "Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining/reading your code-
 * -is a violent psychopath who knows where you live." -Martin Golding)
 *
