#0: Command line

Terminal commands i'll teach you about real quick
This is your cheat-sheet because even it's hard to remember at first

Command - What it stands for: Aiden's silly explination (This line is your key :P)


pwd - print working directory: This shows you "where" you are. Like a "You are here" on a map!


ls - list: Shows all the files in in the current folder


cd - change directory: "Directory" means folder. So cd lets you "change folder" and move around the system!


clear - cler screen: This is like refreshing your screen. It cleans off all the old code. It's my personal life saver


javac - java compile: Before you can run your code, it has to compile (i'll explain in person). 


java "ClassFile" - run java code: This will run your code! Ahhhhh it's working yaaay! 
                                  Run this after you compile. Make sure you don't add the ".java" just the Class name!
