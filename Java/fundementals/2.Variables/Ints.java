/*  #1: Integers
 *  Java has a few different types of numbers, but the most common one is the integer.
 *  Integers are whole numbers (not decimals) that can be positive or negative.
 *  You can do math with them!
 * 
 *  Whenever you want to use a variable, you have to declare it first.
 *  To declare an integer, type "int" and then the name of the variable.
 *

public class Ints {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        // int variable declaration (making it exist)
        int yearJavaWasCreated;

        // assignment (giving it a value)
        yearJavaWasCreated = 1996;

        // declaration and assignment (all in one! This is the normal way to do it)
        int fakeFakeExample = 8;

        // And now we can use it! We can print our variable like this
        System.out.println(yearJavaWasCreated);

/*
 *  Do you notice how i'm naming the variables in a certain way?
 *  It's called camelCase, and it's the standard way to name variables in Java.
 *  It's a good idea to name your variables something that makes sense.
 *  (Remember the psycopath who knows where you live? Don't upset them!)
 * 
 *  You'll always name java variables in camelCase.
 *  Start lowercase, and capitalize the first letter of each word.
 *  thisIsAnExampleOfCamelCaseAndItIsVeryLong
 *  ThisIsNotCamelCaseEither    (capital letter no no)
 *  _thisIsNotCamelCase         (underscore no no)
 *  1thisIsNotCamelCaseEither   (numbers no no)
 *  
 *  this2IsCamelCase            (numbers are okay in the middle)
